## 5. CONTRIBUTIONS

If you want to contribute to this project, it is required, that you (contributor)
fill and digitally sign document [Contributor License Agreement](CLA/Contributor_License_Agreement.pdf),
because I want to have a freedom to do whatever I want with my library, without obligation
to someone else. But I would strongly prefer, if you want to contribute, to contribute
in a form of testing, consultation, giving advices etc. I would like to write this library
entirely by myself.

## 6. COMPILING

Compilation on Windows and Linux is available. There are two options for Windows,
and one for Linux. To compile this project, compiler supporting C++20 is needed.
On Windows, you can use Visual Studio 2019, clang or mingw. On linux, only GCC 10
was tested.

### Compilation instructions (.pro file, Windows, Visual Studio):
1. Download Visual Studio 2019
2. Download Qt, minimal supported version is 5.14.2
3. Download [precompiled libraries](https://github.com/JakubMelka/PdfForQt-Dependencies),
   or compile them yourself. Libraries must be in same root directory as this project,
   so root folder of this project will have a sibling folder with these libraries
4. Open Qt Creator and root project Pdf4Qt.pro
5. Create target for Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 and compile the project

### Compilation instructions (.qbs file, Windows/Linux)
For QBS build, you will need to install [Conan](https://conan.io/), a C++ package manager, Qt framework
(minimal supported version is 5.14.2), and compiler supporting C++20 (Visual Studio 2019, Clang, Mingw,
GCC).
1. Prepare prerequisites (Conan, Qt, compiler)
2. Open QBS project file
3. Build

## 7. DISCLAIMER

I wrote this project in my free time. I hope you will find it useful!
